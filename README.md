<h1>STANFORD-FINAL-PROJECT</h1>
This is my final project , I use covid-19 reports: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19<br>
Make big dictionaries then I create an image that shows the distribution of death and confirmed and<br>
recovered in 3 three different pages with a different colour.<br>
Each sign is related to a specific country(lat, long), the max size of a sign is 15 and the min size is 1 and is<br> related to the number of reports.<br>

Also, there is a graph for each country (if the county has states you have to say which state)that shows the changes in 16 months.<br>

///Here we have all of countries except USA<br>
Between 1/22/2020 - 5/25/2021.<br>
