# Standford-final-project
this is my final project , I use covid-19 reports:https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
and make big dictionaries then I create an image that shows the distribution of death and confirmed and
recovered in 3 three different pages with a different colour.
each sign is related to a specific country(lat, long), the max size of a sign is 15 and the min size is 1 and is related to the number of reports.

also, there is a graph for each country (if the county has states you have to say which state)that shows the changes in 16 months
between 1/22/2020 - 5/25/2021.
