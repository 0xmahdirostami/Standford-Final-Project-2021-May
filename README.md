# standford-final-project
this is my final project 
i use covid-19 reports :https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
and make big dictionartied then i creat an image that shows the distribbution of death and confirmed and
 recovered in 3 three diffrent pages with diffrenet color.
each sign is related to specific country(lat ,long) ,the max size of sign is 15 and 
the min size is 1 realted to the amount of reporst

also there is a graph for each country (if county has states you have to say wich state)that shows the changes in 16 months
between 4/12/2020 - 5/25/2021 .
